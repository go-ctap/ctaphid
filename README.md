# go-ctaphid

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/savely-krasovsky/go-ctaphid.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/savely-krasovsky/go-ctaphid)

go-ctaphid is an idiomatic Go library implementing the CTAPHID transport protocol to interact with FIDO2 authenticators,
featuring a clean, modern API with multiple layers of abstraction.

## Key Features and Architecture

The library exposes several abstraction levels, allowing you to choose the API that best suits your needs:

1. **Transport Layer (`ctaphid`)**

   Direct access to the raw CTAPHID transport protocol. If you need maximum control, you can communicate with devices
   at the frame level.

2. **Protocol Layer (`ctap`)**

   Implements CTAP 2.2 protocol messaging atop the transport, letting you work with high-level commands and
   CBOR-encoded messages.

3. **Device Abstraction (`device`)**

   Provides a convenient wrapper over the `ctap` package, managing device descriptor and abstracting channel (CID)
   management, so you donâ€™t have to handle these low-level details manually.

4. **Scenario Helpers (`sugar`)** _(Mostly TODO now)_

   A growing set of utility functions for common use-cases. These helpers streamline trivial or repetitive
   scenarios, letting you get started quickly without deep protocol knowledge.

## Highlights

- Implements major FIDO2 commands: MakeCredential, GetAssertion, ClientPIN (with both PIN/UV methods),
  Reset, CredentialManagement, and more.
- Both low-level access and ergonomic, high-level APIs.
- Modern Go design, making use of language features like iterators.
- `cgo` is currently used for HID transport, but FIDO2 protocol logic is pure Go.

- [ ] `cgo`-free version.
