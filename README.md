go-ctaphid is an idiomatic Go library implementing the CTAPHID transport protocol to interact with FIDO2 authenticators,
featuring a clean, modern API with multiple layers of abstraction.

> [!WARNING]
> Work in progress! API may change during `v0.x`!

## Current Status

Library supports almost entire CTAP 2.2 specification, except few extensions which are not yet seen in the wild
(`hmac-secret-mc`, dedicated `largeBlob`, not to be confused with `largeBlobKey` which is supported).

My current priorities are to write better tests and completely replace [sstallion/go-hid](https://github.com/sstallion/go-hid)
with the [own](https://github.com/go-ctap/hid) `cgo`-free alternative.

## Key Features and Architecture

The library exposes several abstraction levels, allowing you to choose the API that best suits your needs:

1. **Transport Layer (`ctaphid`)**

   Direct access to the raw CTAPHID transport protocol. If you need maximum control, you can communicate with devices
   at the frame level.

2. **Protocol Layer (`ctap`)**

   Implements CTAP 2.2 protocol messaging atop the transport, letting you work with high-level commands and
   CBOR-encoded messages.

3. **Device Abstraction (`device`)**

   Provides a convenient wrapper over the `ctap` package, managing device descriptor and abstracting channel (CID)
   management, so you donâ€™t have to handle these low-level details manually.

4. **Scenario Helpers (`sugar`)** _(Mostly TODO now)_

   A growing set of utility functions for common use-cases. These helpers streamline trivial or repetitive
   scenarios, letting you get started quickly without deep protocol knowledge.

## Highlights

- Implements major FIDO2 commands: MakeCredential, GetAssertion, ClientPIN (with both PIN/UV methods),
  Reset, CredentialManagement, and more.
- Both low-level access and ergonomic, high-level APIs.
- Modern Go design, making use of language features like iterators.
- `cgo` is currently used only for macOS version (for HID transport), but FIDO2 protocol logic is pure Go.

## Build Dependencies

### Linux
For Linux systems, you'll need to install the following packages to build:
- `libudev-dev`: udev device management library
- `libusb-1.0-0-dev`: USB device access library

## Planned Improvements

- [ ] Better tests (using virtual authenticator?)
- [ ] Extended "sugar" helpers for common use-cases.
- [ ] `cgo`-free version for macOS. See [go-hid](https://github.com/go-ctap/hid).
