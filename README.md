go-ctap is an idiomatic Go library for interacting with FIDO2 authenticators using CTAP.
It exposes several abstraction levels, from raw CTAPHID transport framing to ergonomic authenticator workflows.

> [!WARNING]
> Work in progress! API may change during `v0.x`!

## Current Status

Library supports almost entire CTAP 2.2 specification, except few extensions which are not yet seen in the wild
(`hmac-secret-mc`, dedicated `largeBlob`, not to be confused with `largeBlobKey` which is supported).

My current priorities are to write better tests and completely replace [sstallion/go-hid](https://github.com/sstallion/go-hid)
with the [go-ctap/hid](https://github.com/go-ctap/hid) `cgo`-free alternative.

## Key Features and Architecture

The library exposes several abstraction levels, allowing you to choose the API that best suits your needs:

1. **Transport Layer (`transport/ctaphid`)**

   Direct access to the raw CTAPHID transport protocol. If you need maximum control, you can communicate with devices
   at the frame level.

2. **Client Layer (`client`)**

   Implements CTAP command messaging atop the transport, letting you call authenticator commands while still managing
   the device handle, channel ID, PIN/UV auth tokens, and command inputs yourself.

3. **Authenticator Layer (`authenticator`)**

   Provides a convenient wrapper over the `client` package, managing the HID device descriptor, channel ID (CID),
   cached authenticator info, and common CTAP flows.

4. **Discovery Helpers (`discover`)**

   A set of helpers for finding and selecting authenticators, including user-presence based selection when
   several authenticators are connected.

5. **Crypto Helpers (`crypto`)**

   Public helpers for CTAP-specific cryptography, including PIN/UV Auth Protocol One and Two, and LargeBlob
   encryption/decryption. The lower-level `crypto/protocolone` and `crypto/protocoltwo` packages are available for
   callers that need direct access to the protocol primitives.

6. **Protocol Model (`protocol`)**

   CTAP command constants, request/response wire structures, options, permissions, parsed authenticator data, and
   CTAP extension wire inputs/outputs.

7. **Domain Types (`credential`, `attestation`, `extension`, `webauthn`)**

   Shared public-key credential primitives, attestation statement formats, extension identifiers/policies, and
   WebAuthn-shaped extension input/output structures used across the lower-level and higher-level APIs.

## Highlights

- Implements major FIDO2 commands: MakeCredential, GetAssertion, ClientPIN (with both PIN/UV methods),
  Reset, CredentialManagement, and more.
- Both low-level access and ergonomic, high-level APIs.
- Modern Go design, making use of language features like iterators.
- `cgo` is currently used only for the macOS HID backend, but CTAP protocol logic is pure Go.
